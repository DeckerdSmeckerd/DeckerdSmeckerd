### Hello programmers. I am restarting this programming hobby.

I am really interested in the new developemnts in the field of AI. It is very exciting to see what people have been doing. I am jumping in to learn what I can.

I learned to program in BASIC on an apple computer in the 80s. The basic spaghetti code. GOTO statements and all that. I played around with it for a couple of years. I was in my mid teens. My best program was a simple graphical game based on TRON. Two people used four keys each on the keyboard to control their individual graphical line that was constantly being drawn. The goal was to box each other in. There was a border around the screen. Running into the border or the other player's line was a loss.

Programming was something my father and I both learned to do in those days and we had many good collarborations and fun. He did manage to break my simple TRON game though. After a while, he realized he could hold down a key at the right moment and block further input, thus not allowing me to turn away from a collision.

I also took some classes while I was working on a military base in Germany in the early 2000s. I learned C++ from an instructor named Jerry Rugg. He was a very intelligent man and a good teacher.

I have piddled with programming over the years and mainly with C#, which I like very much. As I write this in March 2024, I don't have anything very specific in mind to focus on, but I discovered Semantic Kernal yesterday and since I already have a ongoing fascination with OpenAI's products, I think that is where I want to start.
